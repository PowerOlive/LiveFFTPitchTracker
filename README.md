# LiveFFTPitchTracker


This repository is dedicated to several tools.

A first one is a live FFT plotter, which plots the signal acquired by the microphone and its spectrum.

A second one implements several pitch tracking algorithms to find the pitch of the sound currently being played. In particular, investigated algorithms are:

- harmonic product spectrum
- maximum likelihood
